Using the orientation of the drone and some assumed properties, the geo-location of the affected person is detected by mapping his location in the 2D image to a 3D coordinate using a custom-built algorithm. This data is plotted on a dashboard and sent to a PWA (Progressive Web App) to assist on field search and rescue operations.</p><h3 id=drones>Drones<a href=#drones class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>The drone carries a high definition camera and equipment to relay the video feed to the base station in real time. This feed is the processes along with some additional information from the drone.</p><figure class=center><img src=/drone.gif><figcaption class=center>Drone: Hexacopter V1</figcaption></figure><p>The drones follow a hexagonal mapped path. This allows the drones to cover the maximum affected area in the miminum amount of time.
