# Hello there! :wave:
I'm a technology enthusiast, driven by the ability to use latest technologies, to solve real world problems. I care about developing practically impactful methods, while at the same understanding why the methods work, and the foundations for building models that learn and generalize.

At **iQGateway**, I work on implementing novel data driven solutions to a number of problems ranging from **Education, Recommendation systems, AutoML and Computer Vision**. I have completed my undergraduate studies at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore with a major in Computer Science and Engineering (with Honors).
