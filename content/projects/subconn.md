A Progressive Web App to track subsidized product transactions using distributed ledgers, hence improving efficiency and transparency in the distribution of goods and services through various Govt. schemes.

The algorithm includes a unique forward pass that integrates the tokens with the blockchain to allow for a back propagation to detect and handle errors. The block chain secures the item transactions and maintains the path followed by each item

### Problem statement
 - The government spends $13.6 billion per year on the Public
Distribution System(PDS)
 - With the total subsidies provided added up to a staggering Rs. 2400 billion.
 - These services do not reach the targeted people due to corruption in the system
 - This is clearly visible by the fact that 21% of the population still remain undernourished.

### Solution
 - Tracking the products from the supplier to the consumer through the chain.
 - Eliminate tampering by middlemen.
 - Maintain quality control of the goods.
